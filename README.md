# Manufacturing Margin & Utilization Dashboard

This project analyzes gross margin performance in a manufacturing environment by examining the impact of utilization levels and fixed cost absorption.

## Problem Statement
Manufacturing operations with high fixed costs can experience margin erosion even when revenue is stable. This dashboard was built to understand why gross margins turn negative and which operational drivers are responsible.

## Approach
- Analyzed utilization trends, fixed and variable costs, and revenue metrics
- Applied unit-level and aggregate cost logic to assess fixed cost absorption
- Designed executive-focused KPIs and visual diagnostics in Tableau

## Key Insights
- Under-utilization (~63%) significantly increases fixed cost per unit
- Fixed cost absorption, rather than pricing or variable cost inefficiency, is the primary driver of negative margins
- Improving utilization is critical for margin recovery in capital-intensive manufacturing setups

## Tools Used
- Tableau
- Data visualization and dashboard design
- Cost and margin analysis concepts
